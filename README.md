# Playwright Learning Environment

This repository contains resources to help you get started with Playwright for web automation and testing.

## Contents

- **`webapp/`**: A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application. This was the initial application provided for basic Playwright testing.
- **`playwright-react-app/`**: A more advanced React application built with Vite and Material UI, featuring a login and dashboard flow. This application is ideal for practicing Playwright tests on a modern web stack.
- **`notes/playwright_notes.md`**: Markdown file containing notes, key features, basic usage, and useful commands for Playwright.

## Getting Started with the React App

To run the React application (recommended for Playwright testing):

1.  **Navigate to the React app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd playwright-react-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Login Credentials for React App

-   **Username:** `testuser`
-   **Password:** `testpass`

## Playwright Testing

You can use this environment to write and run Playwright tests against either the simple `webapp` or the more feature-rich `playwright-react-app`. Refer to `notes/playwright_notes.md` for Playwright installation and basic usage.
